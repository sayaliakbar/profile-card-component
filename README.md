## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML5** for semantic markup
- **CSS3** custom properties
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid styling
- **Flexbox** for layout

---

### What I Learned

Here are some key concepts and techniques I learned while working on this project:

1. **Using Tailwind CSS for Rapid Styling**:

   - Tailwind’s utility-first approach allowed me to style the component quickly without writing custom CSS.

   ```html
   <div
     class="w-60 h-[400px] bg-gray-200 rounded-md shadow-2xl shadow-black border-2 border-black"
   ></div>
   ```

2. **Flexbox for Centering and Layout**:

   - Used `flexbox` for aligning and centering elements inside the card:

   ```css
   display: flex;
   justify-content: center;
   align-items: center;
   ```

3. **Responsive Design**:

   - Tailwind’s responsive utilities allowed me to ensure the design works well across different screen sizes without needing custom media queries.

4. **Structured HTML**:
   - Focused on structuring the HTML properly for better readability and accessibility:
   ```html
   <p class="text-black font-bold text-2xl">Robert Downey Jr</p>
   ```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to:

- Further explore **Tailwind CSS** to improve development speed.
- Implement **accessibility best practices** for users with disabilities.
- Experiment with **CSS Grid** for advanced layouts.
